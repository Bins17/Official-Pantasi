        <div class="rule-section">
            <h2>D. LINEUP CHANGES ANSWERS</h2>
            <p>1. Canceling players more than the required cancel BUT there are still non-playing cancelled players, it can still be replaced as long as the adjusted cancelled players will meet the REQUIRED max cancel.
            <p>2. If a player on the Lineup becomes QUESTIONABLE after initially selecting it healthy, the user CAN change players, or even change of all of them, as long as each of the player that will be replaced is NOT YET PLAYING. if the questionable player in the ORIGINAL/first lineup becomes healthy, it will still remain with the 2nd or newly changed Lineup.  </p>
            <p>3. If a player on the Lineup gets INJURED, you can replace it with players that is not playing yet, you are also freely to change other positions as long as the ones you are going to replace are NOT PLAYING YET.
        </div>

        <!-- Rule 2: Games Played -->
        <div class="rule-section">
            <h2>E. Violations/Issues, with Another Chance</h2>
            <p>1. If a Quadro team still has not set/not submitted a set and the games has started, you can still set and select players that are NOT ONGOING, refer to the "Updated Salary for late Sets" section. </p>
            <p>2. If the set was not submitted or forgot to submit, or if it is only submitted in the group messenger, and vice versa.. send it again, if the games has already started, then replace the ongoing players and replace it with non ongoing. </p>
            <p>3. Cancelled more players than the required, just changed the cancelled players until the required amount is reached. This is if the cancelled players are not yet playing, and you can only change the non-playing cancelled players.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Rule 2: Games Played -->
        <div class="rule-section">
            <h2>F. Violations/Issues, with Automatic Default</h2>
            <p>1. Canceling players more than the required cancel, if all the players cancelled have already began playing. </p>
            <p>2. Overpriced Lineup, this should no longer be an issue, because of the new fantasy website that checks the lineup if it is exceeds the required salary upon clicking "GetLineup", if you are a late set, then compute the required salary for yourself.
